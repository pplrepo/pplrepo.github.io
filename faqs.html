			<p id="answer"> A doula is a trained and experienced who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to a birthing person (and their partner if 				they have one) before, during, and after birth.<br><br>
			While doulas are a wealth of information and knowledgeable in many aspects of labor <b>they do not provide any type of medical care</b>.<br><br>
			From unmedicated birth to a cesarean, and everything in between, your doula will act as your advocate, helping you fulfill specific desires during times of 				vulnerability. </p>
			
			<p id="question"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="active" onclick="hide1()"><b>What does a birth doula do?<span style="float:right;padding-right: 20px;";>&#8690;</span></b></p></a>
			<p id="answer1">Birth doulas meet with you prenatally, offering support throughout your labor and birth, and is there for you as you transition into your postpartum 				chapter. Some things that are included in doula work: prenatal visits, telephone/email support, on-call availability, continuity of care, assistance and support during 			labor and birth, assistance with optimal fetal positioning (which can be discussed prenatally and utilized during the birth process), aromatherapy, massage, 				breastfeeding support, resources and much more.<br><br>

			<p id="answer2"> Postpartum doulas work with you during those first moments at home, typically ranging from a couple weeks to a couple months. Postpartum doulas 				provide unbiased, evidence-based information, and create a safe space for you to feel comfortable and cared for. You will receive assistance with newborn care, light 				household tidying, food preparation, lactation, laundry and more. Postpartum doulas provide critical support during the often overlooked "fourth trimester."<br><br>

			<p id="question"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="active" onclick="hide3()"><b>Is a Doula like a Midwife?</b> <span style="float:right;padding-right: 20px;";>&#8690;</span></p></a>
			<p id="answer3"> No, a Doula is not like a Midwife. A Doula is not qualified to perform any medical procedures including but not limited to, blood pressure checks, 			assessments, postpartum checkups, mental health assessments, etc. A Doula is NOT and does NOT replace a health care provider such as a Midwife or OB.<br><br>

			While they often have similar approaches, a midwife differs from a doula significantly. A midwife is medically licensed and the primary focus of their care is on the 				health and safety of you and your baby. Both doulas and midwives work with you prenatally, support you throughout the birth and follow up with you postpartum. 				Specifically, at a birth, doulas are often found doing hip squeezes, refilling your water bottle, providing guidance and reassurance (to you and your partner), and 			repeating affirmations that empower you. At a birth, midwives may be found doing similar things as a doula, but their priorities include: ensuring that you and baby's 				vital signs are stable, assessing you and your baby, completing cervical exams when needed, administering medication if necessary, and catching the baby you are 				birthing.<br><br>

			Doulas and midwives go together like peanut butter and jelly!<br><br>

			Multiple randomized control studies have found that the presence of a trained doula benefits everyone. The studies have consistently shown that doula care is 				associated with shorter labors, less use of epidurals and other pain medications, lower episiotomy rates, and as much as a 50% reduction in the C-section rate. 			Research has also shown better clinical outcomes for both the mother and the baby (including fewer admissions to neonatal special care units, better breastfeeding 				rates, and better family bonding). A doula also provides care for the mother’s partner and other family members, assists busy hospital staff, saves money, and greatly 				increases a mother’s overall satisfaction with her birthing experience. </p>

			<p id="question"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="active" onclick="hide4()"><b>Is a Doula the same thing as a Midwife? </b> <span style="float:right;padding-right: 20px;";>&#8690;</span></p></a>
			<p id="answer4">No. A doula provides no medical or nursing care. Since she doesn’t have these responsibilities, or other patients to attend to, she can give her 				complete attention to being by a woman’s side for the entire length of her labor. </p>
			
 			<p id="question"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="active" onclick="hide5()"><b>What is a birth doula? </b> <span style="float:right;padding-right: 20px;";>&#8690;</span></p></a>
			<p id="answer5">A birth doula provides emotional and physical support, along with resources and birth preparation to an expecting family prenatally, during birth and 				shortly after.</p>
			
 			<p id="question"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="active" onclick="hide6()"><b>Does a doula replace the father or partner? </b> <span style="float:right;padding-right: 20px;";>&#8690;</span></p></a>
			<p id="answer6">Doulas do NOT replace partners! A Doulas job is to educate emotionally and physically support partners to empower them to support mothers (birthing 			person) through the birthing process. A doula is additional support not a replacement of any sort, supporting everyone in their own role. A doula’s presence helps 				partners participate at their own comfort level, showing them how and when to use various comfort techniques, providing information, and in some cases, looking after 				them as well.

 			<p id="question"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="active" onclick="hide7()"><b>What are the benefits of having a doula?</b> <span style="float:right;padding-right: 20px;";>&#8690;</span></p></a>
			<p id="answer7">
			Studies have shown higher rates of having a “positive birth experience” when a doula is present.<br><br>

			With the support of a doula there is:<br>

			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Decreased anxiety<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Improved postpartum mental health<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Better breastfeeding outcomes<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Improved relaxation<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Boosted self esteem<br><br>
 
			A doula may offer:<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Emotional reassurance, comfort, and encouragement<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Attention to physical comfort<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Assistance with breathing<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Information about what's happening during labor and the postpartum period, including explanations 				of procedures<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Help with facilitating communication between you and the hospital staff<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Guidance and support for loved ones<br>
			<span><img src="favicon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px"></span> Assistance with breastfeeding<br><br>

			Sometimes, when birth doesn’t go as planned and medical interventions or a cesareans needed, the situation leaves the mother feeling unprepared, disappointed, and 				alone. In this case, your doula will provide emotional, informational, and physical support. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="border:solid black 2px; padding:20px; background-color:white;">
			<b>As your Doula I will:</b>
			
			Provide you with information and help you learn about the process of birth so that you can make choices that align with your values.<br><br>
			Listen to you with compassion and respect the decisions you make for you and your baby, even if they are different than the choices I would make for myself.<br><br>
			Help you feel prepared for all kinds of outcomes knowing that if your body or baby need assistance you have not failed. Birth is beautiful regardless of the 				circumstances. I will help you respect your body and honor the complicated and unpredictable process of birth.<br><br>
			Offer you my full support during moments of vulnerability and celebrate with you in your moments of strength.<br><br>
			I believe in you – I know you can do this!
